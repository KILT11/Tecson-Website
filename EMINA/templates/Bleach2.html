        <h2>Episdoe 2: A Shinigami's Work</h2>
       <p>  Ichigo waking up to find his home damaged from the previous night's Hollow attack and his family seemingly
            oblivious to the true events. Ichigo is surprised to find Rukia enrolled as a transfer student at his school,
            where she explains her predicament: she's stuck in a temporary human body and needs Ichigo to cover her Soul
            Reaper duties since he absorbed most of her powers. Despite Ichigo's initial reluctance, Rukia forces his soul
            out of his body to demonstrate the gravity of the situation. This leads to Ichigo's first Soul Reaper duty,
            where he witnesses a Plus being attacked by a Hollow and ultimately steps in to defeat it, sending the Plus
            to the Soul Society. The episode also introduces Orihime Inoue, one of Ichigo's classmates, and hints at
            her connection to the supernatural, as her deceased brother begins his transformation into a Hollow.</p>
